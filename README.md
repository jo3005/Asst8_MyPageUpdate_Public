# Assignment 8 of the FSBootcamp is to create a responsive portfolio website using Bootstrap

## Site URL

https://jo3005.github.io/Asst8_MyPageUpdate/


## Description

The website currently has three pages:

index.html: the main page,
portfolio.html: contains prior websites that have been created,
contacts.html Buttons have been created for two more (art folio and research papers). If this was live, I would hide these or make them look disabled until they were complete.
The website uses a bootstrap 4.0 framework.

Minimal additional javascript has been written at this stage, although the bootstrap classes require some javascript, so this has been included.

An additional css page adapts the standard bootstrap presentation and adds some formatting for my additional classes. Some pseudo classes have been included to add transparancy to background boxes so as to not affect the transparancy of sub-classes.

## Changes to Assignment 2

Added a selection of new assignments.
Added user form.


## Future Work

Create Art and Publications pages.
Trial a lighter version of the page.
Add a landing page.
Make the contact form php code work.
